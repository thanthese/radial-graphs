# What are these?

I call them *radial graphs*. They're an alternative way to visualize
harmonic theory. Advantages:

- Uniform spacing. Unlike on a musical staff, equal distances mean equal
  intervals.

- Make intervals obvious. For example, straight line always means a
  tritone.

- Ignore inversions. There's no top and bottom to worry about, and no
  voicings either. Focus on the theory.

So far as I can google, I think I invented them. If you know different,
please drop me a line.

6 ways: by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. Doing this, we see
